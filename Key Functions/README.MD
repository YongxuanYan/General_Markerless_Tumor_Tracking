generate_Simulated_X-ray_from_DRR.py : As illustrated by its name, it is used to generate simulated X-ray fluoroscopic images from DRR.

set_fiducial_marker_area_obvious.py : it contains a interactive tool to select and expand fiducial marker in CT data simply by click the fiducial marker in a plot window. It requires globals.py to work properly.

tack_fiducial_markers.py : It is used to tracking fiducial marker from image sequences with Optical flow.

compute_intersection_fiducial_marker.py and compute_intersection_tumor_LPF_adaptive.py : they are used to calculate 3D trajectories of fiducial markers and tumor centers from 2D trajectories. Figure~5 from our paper is generated using analyze_global_frequency in compute_intersection_tumor_LPF_adaptive.py.

analyze_3D_trajectory_errors.py is used to generate 3D trajectory comparison as shown in Figure.14
